2. **Vercel issues**
   - Had some issues with Vercel deployments. Pushed a broken build to repo on accident

### Next Steps:

1. **Cart System:**
   - Develop a cart system for the shop.

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Implement a search option. Allow users to easily find products or content they are looking for.

3. **Invdividual products:**
   - Need to create pages for individual products

## WEEKLY PROGRESS, STATUS AND PROBLEMS, 2/4

- Add cart and search functionality

### Challenges & Issues
1. **Cart System Data:**
   - Passing props proved troublesome. Opted out for global state management react context.
### Next Steps:
1. **Multiple browser support:**
   - Test compability with other browers, tested only on Firefox
2. **Add modal popups:**
   - Alert the user that the result of their actions. Example, if user adds an item to cart, a green modal popups with message "Item added to cart". Or if a user fails to login for some reason, a red modal popups with message "Login Failed. Try again."
