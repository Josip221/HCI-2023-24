# Class project 1: Figma Essentials

Project Tasks:

Create a simple responsive hero section in Figma; elements/components in your Figma frame should nicely behave as you resize the corresponding parent frame.
The hero section will include a menu. Make menu items a Figma component.
Use auto-layout, auto-spacing, constraints features.
Deliverables:

Record a short video (10-20sec) of your hero section frame. Prove that it is responsive and that you can easily change look and feel of menu items. You can use OBS Studio for recording.
Upload the video to your repository (use the provided GitHub repo template to organize your files).
